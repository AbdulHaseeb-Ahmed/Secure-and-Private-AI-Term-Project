- FGSM_v2: Similar to v1 but now is incorporated with visual representation of attacks versus the original image. 
  - Shows all instances of a single attack versus the original example
- FGSM_v3: Similar to v2 but now has data on attack statistics.
  - Shows all instnces of the attack on epsilon = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.95 as well as shows the original image. In addition statistical data is presented which shows accuracy of classifier per attack as well as per label.
- FGSM_v4_Avgs: This is the final version of the attack with averaging done to get better statistical results on the attack.
